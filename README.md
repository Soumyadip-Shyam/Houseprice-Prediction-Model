# Houseprice-Prediction-Model

### Dataset used is from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data/data

## Objectives and working of the Model:-
### • To design a Machine Learning model to predict real estate price of Bangalore city and export model to a Pickle file
### • Performed data munging and wrangling on raw data, feature engineered data, reduce dimensionality, removed outliers based on business logic, statistics, visualized trends to optimize data. Used One Hot encoding for location feature.
### • Implemented machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Decision Tree. Used K Fold cross validation on regression algorithm and got accuracy above 80% in just 5 iterations
### • Applied GridSearchCV on all the models and came up with final model with accuracy of 84.77% to predict house prices
